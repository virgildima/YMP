What is the point of a maintenance program if you have to spend most of your time trying to configure the program instead of getting any real work done?

It\\u2019s simple to use, yet highly effective in helping you manage the everyday work required onboard yachts, and the price for the program is the lowest on the market, making it one of the best value systems available. With the use of YMP you can improve the organization, efficiency and effectiveness of work for all departments onboard.
